# Dataset Generation & Monitoring Tool

## Project Goals
- Create all-in-one open-source tool for ML dataset understanding, monitoring, and augmentation
- Provide visualization and exploration tools for datasets
- Enable training/experiment monitoring
- Support dataset augmentation via diffusion/LLM methods

## Key Features
- Dataset metrics and diversity insights
- Training/experiment monitoring
- Interactive visualizations
- Dataset augmentation capabilities:
  - Support multiple augmentation techniques
  - Track augmentation history
  - Visualize augmented samples
  - Focus on ML-powered augmentation (diffusion/LLM)

## Dataset Augmentation Goals
- Enable AI-powered dataset expansion
- Support multiple augmentation strategies:
  - Diffusion model-based generation
  - LLM-guided augmentation
  - Traditional augmentation techniques
- Provide augmentation history and tracking
- Allow review/filtering of augmented samples

## Technical Decisions
- React frontend with Material UI for components
- Recharts for data visualization
- React Router for navigation

## Code Quality Guidelines
- Initialize state arrays properly with useState([])
- Ensure proper JavaScript syntax and semicolons
- Validate component code before committing
- Test component rendering with sample data

## File Upload Requirements
- Support image file uploads (.jpg, .png, .gif)
- Validate file types before upload
- Preview support for image files
- Handle file size limits appropriately
